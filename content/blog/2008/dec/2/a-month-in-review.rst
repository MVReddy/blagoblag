A month in review
=================


Today is the last day of blogging every day for a month.  It was harder than I expected, but I ultimately made it, which also surprised me.  For my last post(of the month) I figured I'd share some stats about the blog from the month.
 * About 10k visitors and 13k page views
 * My 3 post popular posts were "What Python learned from Economics", "How the heck do Django Models Work", and "A Timeline View in Django"
 * My top 3 referers were reddit, ycombinator, and the Django project site.
 * Top search keyword was "django models"
 * 2/3 of my viewers were using Firefox
 * Under 3% IE(yay)
 * 28% were Linux users

I don't think I'll ever blog this frequently again(at least not until next November), however I hope to continue writing fairly frequently and I have at least two more posts planned for December.
