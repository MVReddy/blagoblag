Some thoughts on Blogging
=========================

:tags: blogging

As we come to the close of November, I thought I'd take a comment to reflect on blogging.  For one, this is by far more writing than I've ever done.  Also, who thought blog-everyday-month should be November, Thanksgiving at the end really makes it hard to finish strong.  Right now I'm pretty brain dry, hopefully I'll think of something good to finish off the month.  For now I'm just trying to enjoy the long weekend.

I should probably take a chance to say thanks to Brian Rosner, Michael Trier, and anyone else who wouldn't stop pestering me to get a blog.
