An open letter to the security community
========================================


Your community appears to be a disaster. I've already read about the following
happening in your community/conferences:

* `Women stripping being used as a prize in hacker jeopardy`_
* `Jeopardy game features the category "hot pussy"`_
* `Invites to parties being handed out to male speakers and not female speakers`_
* `Objectifying content on slides`_
* Hacking devices of new users at conferences is considered completely
  acceptable

I can only conclude you don't want to be welcoming to new users.

And so I don't participate. Congratulations. You've built a community so
unwelcoming that otherwise interested developers won't be a part of it.

Friends of mine in the security community: I beg of you, don't enable this by
continuing to attend events like this. Don't validate this behavior with your
participation.

Security community, fix your shit.
