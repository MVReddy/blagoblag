Affirmative action
==================

Whenever the topic of affirmative action comes up, you can be sure someone will
ask the question: "How would you feel if you found out that you got your job,
or got into college, because of your race?"

It's funny, no one ever asks: "How would you feel if you got your job, or got
into college, because you were systemically advantaged from the moment you were
born?"

Interesting.
