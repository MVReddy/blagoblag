Moving to Rackspace
===================

:tags: self

As you may have heard by now, I'm joining Rackspace. This was a very hard decision, I love my job at Rdio, I love my coworkers, and I love the product we're building. However, Rackspace has given me an opportunity to make my work on open source projects (particularly PyPy) a major part of my job. I'll also be spending time on OpenStack, the SDKs, and internal developer evangelism. I'll be staying in San Francisco.
