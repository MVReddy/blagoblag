Software Design: 80/20 libraries
================================


I'm trying a new format for content, instead of writing I've recorded some audio, I think this will be a better format for my to share ideas. You can find the audio `here <https://soundcloud.com/alex_gaynor/software-design-80-20>`_.

    <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F73921746&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>

PS: If you know a better workflow for sharing audio like this, please let me know.
