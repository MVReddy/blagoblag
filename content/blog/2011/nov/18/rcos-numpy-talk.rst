RCOS NumPy Talk
===============

:tags: numpy, pypy, rcos

I just delivered a talk at RCOS (the open source center on campus) on some of
the work I've been doing this semester on PyPy's implementation of NumPy. You
can find the slides `here`_, they're built using `html5slides`_, which is
pretty swell (for a tool that makes me write HTML directly that is).
