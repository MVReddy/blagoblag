PyCon 2011 is going to be Awesome
=================================

:tags: pycon, python

If you hang out with Pythonistas you've probably already heard, but if you haven't, come to PyCon!  It's going to be awesome.  Here are just a few reasons why:

 * The talks will be great, I've got 2 that I'm super excited about, but here are five more I wouldn't miss for the world:
    * `"Dude, Where's My RAM?" - A deep dive into how Python uses memory <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/25/>`_
    * `Writing great documentation <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/97/>`_
    * `Panel: Python in Schools: Teaching It and Teaching With It. <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/127/>`_
    * `An (biased) survey of the python web <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/152/>`_
    * `Reverse-engineering Ian Bicking's brain: inside pip and virtualenv <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/198/>`_
    * `Jython Concurrency <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/sessions/228/>`_
 * The hallway track will be amazing.  This is something that not enough people realize at their first PyCon: you don't have to attend every talk, if you get into a great discussion with some other developers between talks just skip the next few, we record the talks so you can have great conversations.
 * The sprints will be incredible.  I've missed the sprints at the last two PyCons, and I'm beyond excited to be able to stay for them this year.  The sprints are a great chance to get involved in an open source project, or just dedicate some time to contributing to one.  Going to them *will* make you a better developer, you'll learn the codebase better and have experienced devs who want nothing more than to give you feedback.

You've got until January 25th to secure the early bird pricing for PyCon tickets, and it is expected to sell-out this year, so `get registered <http://us.pycon.org/2011/tickets/>`_!
