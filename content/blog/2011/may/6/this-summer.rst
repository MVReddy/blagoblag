This Summer
===========

:tags: pypy, python, self

For the past nearly two years I've been an independent contractor working primarily for `Eldarion`_, and it's been fantastic, I can't say enough good things.  However, this summer I'm shaking things up a bit and `heading west`_.  I'll be an intern at `Quora`_ this summer.  They're a Python shop, and it's going to be my job to make everything zippy.  Specifically I'll be making the site run on `PyPy`_, and then tuning the hell out of both their codebase and PyPy itself.  I'm super excited about the chance to get a major site running on PyPy, and to contribute as many performance improvements upstream as possible.
