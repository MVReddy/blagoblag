The West Wing Revisited: Five Votes Down
========================================

This episode follows the White House's attempt to get a gun control bill
through congress. The episode begins with the staff finding out that they're
five votes down, and tracks their attempts to win the votes back. As a result,
almost all the political wrangling is invisible to the general public.

There's a few side-plot elements that are public though. First, the Chief of
Staff, Leo McGarry, breaks up with his wife. Unclear how public this would be.

Second, the White House staff are doing financial disclosures. Only one of
these is interesting: Toby Ziegler's. He bought some stock in an internet
company, then arranged for a friend of his to testify before congress, which
resulted in the value of the stock sky rocketing. In the show he deals with
this by selling the shares and taking a $1 salary for the year. I think in
reality he'd probably have to resign, there's just no way to contain something
so obviously scanadlous looking. This is one of places where our behind-the-
scenes perception violently differs from the public's: *we* know that Toby is
an honest and hard working public servant, but there's no way you'd ever
convince anyone of that with a real politician.

Finally, we return to the central plot. The bill ultimately passes, but it's
generally agreed that it's a pretty crappy bill that doesn't actually do much
to further gun control. The Vice President gets good press for helping secure
the deciding vote. In reality I don't think anyone ever cares about anything
the Vice President does.
