The West Wing Revisited: Enemies
================================

This episode is all about a major banking reform bill in the house. It's just
about to pass, when at the last minute two congresspeople attach a land use
rider. The President declares the land in question, Big Sky, Montana, to be a
national park and states that he will sign the bill. It seems a bit too cute to
ever happen in real life, but frankly, I'm salivating at the idea of a real
president slamming the door on an overreaching congress.

The Washington Post White House correspondent also scores a 30 minutes on-the-
record interview with the President.
