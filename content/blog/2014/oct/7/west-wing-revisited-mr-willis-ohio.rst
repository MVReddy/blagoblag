The West Wing Revisited: Mr. Willis of Ohio
============================================

Welcome back to "The West Wing Revisited", where I try to track down what the
plots of The West Wing would look like to the general public.

First up for this episode, a "mentally unbalanced" woman hops the fence of The
White House. Unlike in our present reality, where the Director of the Secret
Service just resigned over a similar incident, no one loses their job.

Next up, we have a census bill. A key question for this bill is whether
sampling is a legitimate technique for answering the constitutional questions
around the distribution of representatives. The White House favors sampling,
but House Republicans are opposed. The Bill ultimately passes with sampling not
explicitly prohibited, a legislative victory for the Democratic president.

Finally, several senior White House staffers, as well as the President and
Chief of Staff's daughters get into something of a scuffle in a George Town bar
with a group of racist, homophobic, and generally assholish 20 somethings. It's
no obvious to me how much of the incident would be covered by the press.
