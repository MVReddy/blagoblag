The West Wing Revisited: The White House Pro-Am
===============================================

Our episode begins with the First Lady and a 14-year old boy appearing on
television to talk about the exploitation of child labor around the world.

Then Bernie Dahl, the Chair of the Federal Reserve passes away suddenly. (In
the process of these discussions, it's confirmed that the economy is still
humming along nicely.)

The President announces that out of respect for Dahl's memory, he's waiting a
day to nominate a successor (who is widely reported to by Ron Erlich).

It's reported that the First Lady has a preference for Erlich for the next Fed
Chair.

We learn that it's a matter of public knowledge that Zoe and Charlie are
dating.

We learn that the Global Free Trade Markets Access Act will pass congress,
after nearly seven years, and that the President will sign it.
