The West Wing Revisited: Let Bartlet Be Bartlet
===============================================

Two commissioners resign from the Federal Elections Committee. Though
nominations for the FEC are made by the President, traditionally the nominees
have been selected by the congressional leadership from both sides of the
aisle.

Danny Concannon, the White House correspondent for the Washington Post, has
obtained a copy of a memo Mandy Hampton, a senior member of President Bartlet's
campaign and now White House staffer, had written while she was working a
Democratic senator who opposed the President. It outlines the President's
weaknesses and says that Chief of Staff Leo McGarry pulls the President in from
more extreme positions. He writes an article about this.

We learn that the President's job approval rating is at 42% (CNN / USA Today).
