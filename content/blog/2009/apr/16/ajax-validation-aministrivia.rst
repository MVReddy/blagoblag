Ajax Validation Aministrivia
============================

:tags: ajax_validation, django, filter, release

Small administrative note, now that Github has it's own issue tracker users wishing to report issues with django-ajax-validation can now do so on Github, instead of the old Google Code page.  Django-filter users can also report issues on its Github page, in place of the former system of "message or email me", which, though functional, wasn't very convenient.
