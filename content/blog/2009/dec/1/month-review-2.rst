A month in review 
==================

:tags: blogging

I've now been blogging for 30 days in a row, so tonight is just going to be a simple post to finish the month of. First of all, WOW, another month of blogging every day completed. This month was great fun, and I managaged to keep the bullshit filler posts to a minimum (3 or 4 by my count). I also finished the month with 42700 total hits (easily a record), including hitting reddit and Hacker News several times. It's been great fun writing every night, hopefully I'll be able to keep up the regular posts, but for now I plan on taking a nice long nap, then I'll get back to the requests.
