Google Moderator for PyCon ORM Panel
====================================


I'm going to be moderating a panel this year at PyCon between 5 of the Python ORMs(Django, SQLAlchemy, SQLObject, Google App Engine, and web2py).  To make my job easier, and to make sure the most interesting questions are asked I've setup a Google Moderator page for the panel `here <http://moderator.appspot.com/#15/e=2fa6a&amp;t=30668>`_.  Go ahead and submit your questions, and moderate others to try to ensure we get the best questions possible, even if you can't make it to PyCon(there will be a recording made I believe).  I'll be adding my own questions shortly to make sure they are as interesting as I think they are.

Also, if you aren't already, do try to make it out to PyCon, there's still time and the talks look to be really exceptional.
