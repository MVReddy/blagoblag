Announcing django-filter
========================

:tags: django, filter

Django-filter is a reusable Django application I have been working on for a few weeks, individuals who follow me on Github may have noticed me working on it.  Django-filter is basically an application that creates a generic interface for creating pages like the Django admin changelist page.  It has support for defining vairous filters(including custom ones), filtering a queryset based on the user selections, and displaying an HTML form for the filter options.  It has a design based around Django's ModelForm.

You can get the code, as well as tests and docs over at `Github <http://github.com/alex/django-filter/tree/master>`_.  For all bug reports, comments, and other feedback you can send me a message on Github(or message me on IRC) until I figure out a proper bug tracking system.

Enjoy.
