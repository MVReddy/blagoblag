2008 and 2009
=============


Eric Florenzano recently wrote an excellent post titled, `"2008 in Review &amp; 2009 Goals" <http://www.eflorenzano.com/blog/post/2008-review-2009-goals/>`_.  I am now going to blantly steal his idea.

2008:

 * Joined Twitter
 * Voted for the first time
 * Had a blast at PyCon
 * Wrote a reusable Django application and open sourced it
 * Learned git
 * Got accepted at, and began studying Computer Science at RPI
 * Wrote a blog post every day for 30 days in a row
 * Started work on my programming language, Al
 * Contributed heavily to Django
 * Started a blog
 * Proposed a panel for PyCon 2009 and was accepted

And probably quite a bit more.

2009:
 * Continue work on Al, bring it up to a usable state
 * Continue writing on my blog
 * Propose a talk for another conference
 * Continue contributing to Django
 * Become a committer on one of the projects I use
 * Do something interesting over the summer, hopefully a cool internship or Google Summer of Code
 * Do well in class

In light of all the stuff that happened in 2008 I hope these are reasonable goals.
