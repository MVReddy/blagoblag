Django Ajax Validation 0.1.0 Released
=====================================


I've just uploaded the first official release of Django Ajax Validation up to PyPi.  You can get it `there <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-ajax-validation/0.1.0>`_.  For those that don't know it is a reusable Django application that allows you to do JS based validation using you're existing form definitions.  Currently it only works using jQuery.  If there are any problems please let me know.
