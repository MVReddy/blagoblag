Announcing django-admin-histograms
==================================

:tags: admin, django, python, release

This is just a quick post because it's already past midnight here.  Last week I realized some potentially useful code that I extracted from the DjangoDose and typewar codebases.  Basically this code let's you get simple histogram reports for models in the admin, grouped by a date field.  After I released it David Cramer did some work to make the code slightly more flexible, and to provide a generic templatetag for creating these histograms anywhere.  The code can be found on `github <http://github.com/alex/django-admin-histograms>`_, and if you're curious what it looks like there's a `screenshot on the wiki <http://wiki.github.com/alex/django-admin-histograms>`_.  Enjoy.
