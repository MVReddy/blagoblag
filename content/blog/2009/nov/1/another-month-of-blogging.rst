Another month of blogging?
==========================

:tags: blogging

Last year I started this blog during the November, blog every day for a month month.  This year I'm hoping to repeat the feat, blogging every single day this month.  Today's post is a bit light on content, but I'm hoping to give a preview of what I'm going to be blogging about.  This month I'm hopping to blog about advanced Django techniques, Comet (and other HTTP push technology), and I'm probably going to be adding some more political content to the usual technical content of this blog.  Lastly, I'm hoping to move this blog either to another hosted provider, or something on my own servers, but somewhere where I can get a tad bit more control.

In any event here's to a productive month of bloggging!
