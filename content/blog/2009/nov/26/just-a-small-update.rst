Just a Small Update
===================

:tags: blogging

Unfortunately, I don't have an interesting, contentful post today.  Just a small update about this blog instead.  I now have a small widget on the right hand side where you can enter topics you'd like to hear about.  I don't always have a good idea of what readers are interested in, and far too often I reject blog post ideas because I think either, "no one cares about that" or "everyone always knows that" so hopefully this will be both a good way for me to write interesting content that people want to read about, as well as a good way for me to overcome any writers block.  So please submit anything you'd like to hear about, Python, Django, the web, programming in general, compilers, or me ranting about politics, I'm willing to consider any topic.

To my American readers: Happy Thanksgiving!
