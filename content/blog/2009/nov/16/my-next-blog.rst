My Next Blog
============


I've been using this Blogspot powered blog for over a year now, and it is starting to get a little long in the tooth.  Therefore I've been planning on moving to a new, shinny, blog of my own in the coming months.  Specifically it's going to be my goal to get myself 100% migrated over my winter break.  Therefore I've started building myself a list of features I want:

 * Able to migrate all my old posts.  This isn't going to be a huge deal, but it has to happen as I have quite a few posts I don't want to lose.
 * Accepts restructured text.  I'm sick of writing my posts in reST and then converting it into HTML for Blogspot.
 * Pretty code highlighting.
 * Disqus for comments.  I don't want to have to deal with spam or anything else, let users post with Disqus and they can deal with all the trouble.
 * Looks decent.  Design is a huge weak point for me, so most of my time is going to be dedicated to this I think.
 * Django powered!

That's my pony list thus far.  There's a good bet I'll use django-mingus since I've hear such good things about it, but for now I'm just dreaming of being able to write these posts in reST.
