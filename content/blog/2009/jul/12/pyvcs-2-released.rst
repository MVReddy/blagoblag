pyvcs .2 released
=================

:tags: python, release, vcs

Hot on the heels of our .1 release (it's only been a week!) I'm pleased to announce the .2 release of pyvcs.  This release brings with it lots of new goodies.  Most prominent among these are the newly-added Subversion and Bazaar backends.  There are also several bug fixes to the code browsing features of the Mercurial backend.  This release can be found at:
 * PyPi: `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvcs <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvcs>`_
 * Github: `http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/ <http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/>`_

If you find any bugs with this release please report them at:
 * `http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/issues <http://github.com/alex/pyvcs/issues>`_

Thanks for all the contributions to this release, almost everything you see in this release is because community members contributed to it, hardly any new code in here is originally written by `Justin <http://www.justinlilly.com/>`_ or I.

We are hoping to have some exciting announcements for `piano-man <http://github.com/alex/piano-man/>`_ coming up in the next couple of weeks.

Enjoy.
