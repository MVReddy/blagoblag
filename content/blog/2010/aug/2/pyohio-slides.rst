PyOhio Slides
=============

:tags: pyohio, pypy, python, talk, unladenswallow

I've (finally) uploaded the slides from my `PyOhio <http://www.pyohio.org/>`_ talk (I gave a similar talk at `ChiPy <http://chipy.org/>`_).  You can get them `right here <http://www.scribd.com/doc/35240506/Pyohio-Fast-Python>`_, I'll be putting all my slides on Scribd from here on out, they were much easier to upload to than SlideShare, plus HTML5 is awesome!
