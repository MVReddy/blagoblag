:tags: education, open-source

This past weekend I attended a symposium on authentic learning, in Santa Barbara, California.  I gave a talk there about Open Source, and how we emulate the practices of a learning community (as often seen in colleges and universities) and whether the pedagogal practices we engange in (to help get new contributors started, and hopefully guide them to becoming committers) are applicable to other fields.  Unfortunately the talk wasn't recorded, however my slides are available `online <http://www.scribd.com/doc/35967063>`_, there is also an accompanying paper that will be available in the future.
