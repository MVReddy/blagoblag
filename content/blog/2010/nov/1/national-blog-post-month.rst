National Blog Post Month
========================

:tags: blog, blogging, meta

It's November again, and that means National Blog Post Month (`or NAMBLA <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMupwUD8vzk>`_), and it's also the second anniversary of me having a blog.  Once again I'm going to be making an effort to blog post every day, as you can tell I'm off to a great start with this post, Murphy willing the content will improve as the month goes on.
