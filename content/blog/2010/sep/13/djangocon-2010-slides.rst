DjangoCon 2010 Slides
=====================


DjangoCon 2010 was a total blast this year, and deserves a full recap, however for now I only have the time to `post the slides <http://www.scribd.com/doc/37171715/Rethinking-the-Reusable-Apps>`_ from my talk on "Rethinking the Reusable Application Paradigm", the `video has also been uploaded <http://djangocon.blip.tv/file/4108781/>`_.  Enjoy.
