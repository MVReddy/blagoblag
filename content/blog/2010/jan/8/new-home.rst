A New Home
==========


Welcome to the new home of my blog!  I've finally gotten around to setting up everything for myself, no more Blogspot (not that they weren't gracious hosts).  This blog runs a custom blogging engine built on Django, with `django-taggit <http://github.com/alex/django-taggit>`_ for tagging, and `Disqus <http://disqus.com/>`_ for comments.  Hosting is graciously provided by the Steward of Gondor (`Brian Rosner <http://oebfare.com/>`_).  `Mike Malone <http://immike.net/>`_ has given me the domain (you can find the remnants of this domain's former glory `here <http://alexgaynor.net/sexy/>`_).  I'll be migrating all my old posts here just as quickly as I can, for now enjoy the decor.

Edit: I forgot to thanks `James Tauber <http://jtauber.com/>`_ I stole most of my design from `him <http://journeymanofsome.com/>`_.
