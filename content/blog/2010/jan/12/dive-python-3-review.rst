Dive into Python 3 Review 
==========================

:tags: book, python, review

Disclosure: I received a free review copy of Dive into Python 3 from Apress.

Unlike a ton of people I know in the Python world, my experience in learning Python didn't include the original Dive into Python at all, in fact I didn't encounter it until quite a while later when I was teaching a friend Python and I was looking for example exercises.  Since Dive into Python is really a book for people who don't know Python a lot of my views on it are based on how helpful I think it would have been while teaching my friend, since it's pretty difficult to imagine myself not knowing Python as I do.

The first thing to note is that Mark Pilgrim has an absolutely brilliant writing style, even when I was reading about stuff I already knew it was an absolute pleasure.  The next thing to note is that this book is squarely targeted at people who are already programmers who want to learn Python, I don't think it would make a good "my first programming book".  Dive into Python 3 jumps into Python full steam ahead, it dives into Python's datatypes, generators, unit testing, and interacting with the web.

The book is strongly example based, Mark does a great job of showing code and explaining it clearly.  He also does a good job of emphasising best practices such as unit testing.   It also covers some external libraries like `httplib2 <http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/>`_, plus there's stuff on porting your existing libraries to Python 3, and a great appendix.

For all these reasons I think Dive into Python 3 makes a good introduction to Python 3.  But don't take my word for it, Mark has made a point of releasing all of his books `online <http://diveintopython3.org/>`_, free of charge.  So if you think you're in the target audience (or even if you aren't) check it out, it doesn't cost you a dime, which Mark goes above and beyond `the call of duty to ensure <http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9lhvp/dive_into_python_3_mark_pilgrim_has_completed_his/c0d9sw9>`_.
