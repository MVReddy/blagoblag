Linux on the Desktop Dead 
==========================

:tags: open-source

At 10:40 AM this morning Linux on the desktop was pronounced dead by Dr.
Randall Gnu at GPL Memorial Hospital in Portland, Oregon. The cause of death
is, as yet, unknown but it is believed to be the result of two decades of
constant exposure to FUD.

Friends and colleagues were shocked and saddened at the loss of Linux on the
desktop. Said one, "It was so shocking to hear it passed away, it had been
doing so well lately, more users than ever, more non-technical users". Said
another, "People always say, 'I never expected to get this news', but I really
never expected it."

Linux on the desktop had a rocky two decade history, however the last five
years had been characterized by unprecedented growth.

The family has requested that in lieu of flowers donations be made to the
`Linux Foundation`_.
