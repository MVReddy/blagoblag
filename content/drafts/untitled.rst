19 days ago I became a founding member of the new `Digital Service`_ team at the
United States Department of Veterans Affairs. We're a group of developers,
designers, and other folks who are passionate about using our technology skills
to make a difference.

Our goal is to dramatically improve the ability of the VA to use technology to
execute on its mission of serving veterans. More broadly, my hope is that our
work will demonstrate that *all* of government is capable of delivering
fantastic user-centric sites and services. We work closely with the rest of
the VA's staff, with the `United States Digital Service`_, with members of the
`Presidential Innovation Fellowship`_, and with `18F`_.

I joined because nowhere else is there as much of an opportunity to translate
the work I do into a positive impact on people's lives, and at no other time
in history has government been more receptive to contributions from folks like
me. I joined because I was asked to serve my country, and the best reason I
could come up with not to was, "it seems really hard", and `that wasn't going
to fly`_.

The Federal Government has seen many challenges leveraging technology, none
higher profile than `healthcare.gov`_. However, from that project's failures
and `subsequent rebirth`_ came an awareness by the government of the ability
of technologists with expertise in shipping to make a big difference. The VA,
and the Federal Government in general, needs developers with expertise in
operating production systems, we need designers with expertise in designing
for the customers needs above all else, we need project managers with
expertise in prioritizing conceptual integrity above checkboxes.

The work *will* be hard, the challenges great, and the obstacles many. But
that is nothing more than evidence that we need to start immediately; without
immediate attention these problems will only grow larger.

Working for the government was not something I'd ever given much thought to.
But I've always aspired to be the type of developer who shows up with a pull
request, not just a bug report. This is me sending a pull request.

The challenge of fully living up to `President Lincoln's words`_, "to care for
him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan" and
the work of enabling the government to use technology to best serve the
American people cannot be met with merely our tacit support, they must be met
with our committment to contribute, to carry out the work ourselves, to stand
up and say, "You want to dig a ditch? I've got a shovel." The `Digital Service
at the VA is hiring`_, `USDS is hiring`_, `18F is hiring`_. I hope you'll join
us.

    Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change
    the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
