I spend a lot of time arguing about, and defending, lawyers and our justice
system. Our justice system is an adversarial one. It is also an epistemological
one, in the same ways the scientific method is. Our justice system is the basis
for our belief, as a society, as to whether a person is guilty of a crime or
not.

That's a weighty burden. Conviction of a crime, following this process, can
result in being deprived of life or liberty [#]_ [#]_. It's not surprising that
we've crafted such a high bar for conviction. "Beyond reasonable doubt" is not
an easy thing to demonstrate.

But in our system, it's not sufficient to demonstrate this in a vacuum, the
State must demonstrate this in the face of an opposition, who will look for any
way to disprove, discredit, or generally bring into question this conclusion.

And that's the key to understanding our system, a Defense Attorney's job isn't
just to exculpate their client. If a defendant isn't given a reasonable
defense, it brings the entire conviction into question, because it's not the
prosecutor's job to advocate for them -- and if the defense attorney doesn't do
their job, the whole system is out of balance. Without a strong defense the
state cannot be said to have met its burden, and as a society, we aren't
justified in imposing any punishment.

It's somewhat common for people to observe that a prosecutor is being over-
zealous, or that a defense attorney is being under-zealous. But recently we've
seen something a bit novel: an under-zealous prosecutor, in Ferguson, Missouri.

This prosecutor had what, at first blush, should have been a straightforward
job. In the words of Captain Jack Ross, "I represent the government of the
United States without passion or prejudice, and my client has a case." [#]_.

For the purposes of a grand jury proceeding, our justice system actually isn't
adversarial. It's a prosecutor's job to prove that a case has sufficient merit
to move to a full trial. In the words of one New York Judge, "a grand jury
would 'indict a ham sandwich,' if that's what you wanted." [#]_

I believe that as a society we are compelled to believe the results of this
process. Much like the scientific method, if we show that our inputs are
legitimate, and we believe the process is sound, we're bound to the result.
However, when we fail to meet the assumptions of our system, we are equally
bound to reject the result, unless otherwise substantiated. If, for example,
one of the parties is denied their due zealous representation, we **must**
question the results, in the same way we would if new DNA evidence brought into
doubt the basis for a conviction.

In Ferguson, Missouri, the prosecutor failed to uphold their duty of zealous
representation to the people of their city, county, and country. The people of
St. Louis County needed a lawyer to represent their interests. They didn't get
one. The list of aberrations and mistakes made by the prosecuting attorneys is
long, and I won't reproduce it [#]_. The salient point is that this was not a
slip up, or an accident. The St. Louis County D.A.'s failure to zealously
represent their client was an abrogation of their professional and ethical
responsibilities [#]_.

I don't know if they would have secured a conviction had the case gone to
trial. It seems fairly likely to me that the County would not have, given the
number of conflicting testimonies, and the weight frequently given to officer's
testimony. The outrage of this case is not in it's outcome (though it is
objectionable), but rather in it's handling. Through grotesque individual and
structural failings, we've allowed the state to **murder** one of its citizens,
without any due process, or repercussions.

In 1972, in Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court halted death penalties across
the US, because the inconsistency and capriciousness with which it was used was
a violation of the 8th amendment, constituting a cruel and unusual punishment
unto itself.

Today we face a similar issue, but instead of impacting the ultimate outcome of
our judicial process, it occurs at the front of our process, in the way
officers interact with citizens and suspects.
