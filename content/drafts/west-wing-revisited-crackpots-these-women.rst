The West Wing Revisisted: The Crackpots and These Women
=======================================================

This episode covers "Big Block of Cheese Day", where indviduals who normally
couldn't get the time of the day from the White House get to meet with senior
staffers to pitch their pet issue.

This episode shows the viewer that the senior staff are dedicated and hard
working public servants, comitted to serving the issues.

Absolutely none of this episode is public however. How could our real public
servants ever compete with the standard set by the fictional ones?
