Best of PyCon 2014
==================

This year was my 7th PyCon, I've been to every one since 2008. The most
consistent trend in my attendance has been that over the years, I've gone to
fewer and fewer talks, and spent more and more time volunteering. As a result
of which, I can't tell you what the best talks to watch are (though I reccomend
watching absolutely anything that sounds interesting `online`_), nonetheless, I
wanted to write down the two events which absolutely defined PyCon for me.

The first is the swag bag stuffing. This event occurs every year on the
Thursday before the conference. Dozens of companies provide swag for PyCon to
distribute to our attendees, and we need to get it into over 2,000 bags. This
is one of the things that defines the Python community for me. By all rights,
this should be terribly boring and monotonous work, but PyCon has turned it
into an incredibly fun, and social event. Starting at 11AM, half a dozen of us
unpacked box after box from our sponsors, and set the area up. At 3PM, over one
hundred volunteers showed up to help us operate the assembly lines, and in less
than two and a half hours, we'd filled the bags.

The second event I wanted to highlight was an open space session, on
Composition. For over two hours, we discussed the problems with inheritance,
the need for explicit interface definition, what the most idiomatic ways to use
decorators are, and other big picture software engineering topics. We talked
about design mistakes we'd all made in our past, and discussed refactoring
strategies to improve code.

These events are what make PyCon special for me: community, and technical
excellence.
