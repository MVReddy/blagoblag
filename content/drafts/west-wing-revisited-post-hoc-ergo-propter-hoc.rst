The West Wing Revisited: Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc
==================================================

Welcome to the second edition of "The West Wing Revisited".

Today's episode touched on a few different plot lines. First, a prominent
Democratic senator agreed to leave Bill 443 in committee, since the White House
didn't like it. It's never said what the substance of the bill was (my guess is
social security or medicare related). In reality it would never become public
that it was the White House which put the kibbosh on a bill like this, so this
would probably be another "Democrats can't get their shit together" news item.

The next element was the Ryder Cup team declining an invitation to the White
House after the president told a joke about golfers. I have no idea how this
one would play.

A prominent political consultant stops working for the aforementioned senator
and joins the White House. Not newsworthy.

The Vice President has a weird quote about "AC-3C" (some sort of military
project I assume). Mostly this is just weird, it's hard to imagine how the
press would cover it, there's not a political angle, besides "weird".

And finally, an Air Force transport in shot down by the Syrian Army, more on
this next episode.

Overall this episode spends a lot of time establishing the characters' personal
sides, and we all grow to love the president because he speaks latin,
nevertheless what the public sees seems to be entirely negative.
