It doesn't work
===============

:public: false

If you've ever had a conversation about whether a technology was good or not
someone (maybe even you!) has said, "Look at all this stuff people built with
it, therefore it can't be that bad."

And it's true. Ability to build something with a tool is an important quality.
But think to yourself, what technology do you use that you couldn't make a list
of companies or individuals who've used it to build something?

Turns out, "It's possible to build something with it" is a really low bar for a
tool. Tools which are so impossible to build things with that no one actually
does tend not to ever get popular enough that you can find two people who know
enough about them to have a conversation.

So please, don't tell me Heroku uses PostgreSQL, Facebook uses PHP, Google uses
Python, and Twitter uses MySQL. It doesn't mean anything.

Instead, tell me how a tool enables you to build something better, to ship
fewer mistakes, to get features to your customers faster, or maybe even to
enjoy your job more. There's not enough of those in our industry.
