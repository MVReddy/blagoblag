The West Wing Revisited: Six Meetings Before Lunch
==================================================

After three months, Robert Mendoza is confirmed by the Senate as Associate
Justice, United States Supreme Court.

The President's nominee for Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights, wrote an
endorsement for a book advocating slavery reparations for African-Americans in
the US. This has made several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee upset.
We don't see any of his confirmation hearings, but we're left with the
impression that he'll get the position.

In sadder news, Lum Lum, a panda bear at that National Zoo, died, and lots of
American citizens want a new one.

Finally, a son of a major Democratic fundraiser was arrested for possession
with intent to distribute at a George Town frat party, which Zoe also attended.
Zoe tells a reporter for the Charleston Gazette that she didn't know the kid
was going to be at the party.
