Math is Real
============

Right now there's a fierce debate going on. On one side we have technology
companies and privacy advocates pushing for increased encryption, including
"end-to-end" encryption. On the other we have the Federal government,
insisting that companies should introduce backdoors so that law enforcement
can decrypt people's communications.

This is a really stupid debate.

We can talk about whether or not a backdoor is possible, or what the
implications would be for other country's law enforcement, or if such a
backdoor would open us up to attacks of other sorts. But all of this misses
the point.

When the Federal government asks for a backdoor, it's asking for specific
companies to introduce them into specific products.

But the fact of the matter is **math is real**. It is **possible** to build
systems which are secure, and so people will. And attempting to criminalize
the *existance* of secure systems is somewhere between pointless whack-a-mole
and self-destructive (to say nothing of its legality).

The assertion that we need companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Google to
introduce backdoors into their encryption systems so we can stop terrorists is
fundamentally founded on the idea that terrorists are going to just use
commercial-off-the-shelf systems with known backdoors, when it is possible
(and not difficult) to build a secure system (to say nothing of open source
ones which already exist). This is either naive or disingenuous. What they do
achieve is trample on the privacy of people who are not incentivized to seek
out other systems (or to deal with the `incredibly complexity of tools like
GPG`_).
