The West Wing Revisited: Take this Sabbath Day
==============================================

The President is flying back from Stockholm on a Friday evening when the
Supreme Court reject a request for a stay of execution for Simon Cruz, a man
convicted of multiple murders. It was expected that the Supreme Court was going
to send the case back to the 6th circuit court.

The President seeks council from the Pope as to whether he should commute
Cruz's sentence. Ultimately, the President does nothing and Simon Cruz is
executed.
