We don't know what we're doing
==============================

In short: we don't know how to build software, because everything worth doing
is a totally new venture. Because the marginal cost of software is zero,
there's no reason to do anything exactly the same twice, copy-paste works just
fine for that. This means there's little value for software engineers to have
expertise in how to do something over and over again.

Most software engineers therefore spend most of their time doing things they've
never done before, so it's not unreasonable to think we don't have any
expertise in what we're doing.

One of the major consequences of not knowing what we're doing is that it's
pretty hard to predict the road blocks we'll hit. Therefore, it's my contention
that software development methodologies such as Kanban, which are predicated on
predicting blockers in advance, the same as you would on an automobile assembly
line or grocery store, make absolutely no sense.

It's also why going into research has never appealed to me, I'm already delving
into the unknown every day, I don't need a special position in order to
discover something new.

The fact that software has a marginal cost of zero, and that we're always doing
something new, or taking our expertise and trying to -as-a-service it, which
itself is distinct from the "doing it once" variety of software development.
This is why our profession is different from others.
