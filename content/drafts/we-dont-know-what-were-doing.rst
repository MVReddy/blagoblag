We don't know what we're doing
==============================

We don't know how to build software. This is because everything worth doing is
a totally new venture. The marginal cost of producing new copies of software is
zero, as a result there's no reason to do things exactly the same way twice,
copy-paste works just fine for that. This means there's little value for
software engineers to have expertise in how to do something over and over
again.

Most software engineers therefore spend most of their time doing things they've
never done before, so it's not unreasonable to think we don't have any
expertise in what we're doing. Indeed if and when we do get such expertise, we
turn it into a meta-problem of how to turn it into an as-a-service, or how to
add more configuration knobs.

The major consequences of not knowing what we're doing is that it's pretty hard
to predict the road blocks we'll hit. Therefore, it's my contention that
software development methodologies such as Kanban, which are predicated on
predicting blockers in advance, the same as you would on an automobile assembly
line or stocking a grocery store, make absolutely no sense.

It's also why going into research has never appealed to me, I'm already delving
into the unknown every day, I don't need a special position in order to do
that.

This is, I believe, the essential difference between software and many other
fields, and why software often requires new or different practices.
