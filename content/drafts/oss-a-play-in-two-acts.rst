OSS: a Play in Two Acts
=======================

Every once in a while, some high profile individual in the Open Source
community says something jerky. For example, Linus Torvalds is regularly
abrasive in his code reviews.

When this happens we're all told that the Linux process works, and that Linus
writes so much good code, so we should should just overlook the fact that he's
a jerks sometimes.

Earlier this week, kernel developer `Matthew Garrett posted on his blog`_ that
he'd no longer be working on fixing Intel's bugs in the kernel, due to their
handling of their add campaign on a gaming website that wrote about GamerGate.

Here's what one commenter on Reddit's `/r/linux`_ wrote:

    Good riddance. People who behave with this level of obnoxious immaturity
    are a cancer. Their code can never counteract the bullshit they constantly
    drop on the table.

Too bad more communities don't share this attitude towards the abusers and
harassers who are still regularly welcomed in various Open Source communities.
