House and Twitter
=================

When I was younger, I started watching the TV show House M.D., and I really liked it. At some point my mom asked me if I was more sarcastic since I started watching the show. I said of course not, I've always been extremely sarcastic.

I was wrong then. Watching House made being sarcastic cool.

Using twitter makes being snarky and not putting thought into things cool. So I'm quitting twitter. I'm already snarky and not-thoughtful enough, I don't need something to incentivize it for me.

If you still want to chat with me, or, for some unknown reason, hear what I have to say, you can join ``##alex_gaynor`` on freenode, follow this blog, or email me at ``alex.gaynor@gmail.com``.
