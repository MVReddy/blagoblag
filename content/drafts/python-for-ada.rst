Python for Ada
==============

`Last year I wrote`_ about why I think it's important to support diversity
within our communities, and about some of the work `the Ada Initiative`_ does
to support this. The reasons I talked about are good, and (sadly) as relevant
today as they were then.

I'd like to add a few more reasons I care about these issues:

* I'm tired of wondering if I should recommend a local meetup to a friend: what
  if a known harasser shows up?
* I'm tired of having people come up to me at conferences and tell me "this
  whole feminism thing might be going too far".
* I'm tired of having thousands of people show up to leave angry comments
  because I merged a pull request.

I'm very tired of being tired. And yet, I can't even begin to imagine how tired
I would be if I was a recipient of the constant stream of harassment that many
women who speak up receive.

For all these reasons (and one more that I'll get to), I'm calling on members
of the Python community to join me in showing their support for working to fix
these issues, and foster a diverse community, by donating to support the Ada
Initiative.

For the next 5 days, Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Carl Meyer, and myself will be matching
donations, up to $7,5000:

I encourage you to donate to show your support.

I mentioned there was one additional reason this is important to me. A major
theme, for myself, over the last year has been thinking about my ethical
obligations as a programmer (and more broadly, the obligations all programmers
have). I've been particularly influenced by `this blog post`_ by Glyph, and

deeply impacted me.

Whoever came up with the term "User agent" to describe a browser uncovered a
very powerful idea. Computer programs are expected to faithfully execute and
represent the agency of their human operator.

Trying to understand the intent and desire of our users can be a challenging
thing under the best of circumstances. As an industry, we compound this problem
many times over by the underrepresentation of many groups among our workforce.
This issues shows up again and again with service's such as Twitter and
Facebook's handling of harassment and privacy issues. We tend to build
products for ourselves, and when we all look the same, we don't build products
that serve **all** of our users well.

The best hope we have for building programs that are respectful of the agency
of our users is for the people who use them to be represented by the people who
build them. To get there, we need to create an industry where harassment and
abuse are simply unacceptable.

It's a long road, but the Ada Initiative does fantastic work to pursue these
goals (particularly in the open source community, which is near and dear to
me). Please, join us in supporting the ongoing work of building the community I
know we all want to see, and which we can be proud of.
