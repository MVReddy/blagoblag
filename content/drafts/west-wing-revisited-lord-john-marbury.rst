The West Wing Revisited: Lord John Marbury
==========================================

As a result of Congressman Lillienfield's claim that one in three White House
staffers used drugs, Josh Lyman performed an internal investigation. Now, a
group named "Freedom Watch" is subpoenaing senior White House staff to learn
about the results of the investigation, pursuant to the Freedom of Information
Act. It's unclear how much of this would be known by the public, but all the
facts are at least notionally available.

Of far more global import: the Indian Army invades Pakistani held Kashmir
territory. The UN Security Council calls an emergency meeting.

To assist, President Bartlet calls in Lord John Marbury, the former ambassador
to New Delhi from the United Kingdom.

The episode concludes with a 2-week ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
